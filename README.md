## üìå Overview

The simulation focused on scraping and analysing customer review data and building a predictive model to understand what factors influence purchasing behaviour. Deliverables include data analysis notebooks and stakeholder-facing presentations.

## üîß What I Did

- **Web Scraping & Analysis**
  - Scraped hotel review data and explored patterns using visualisations.
  - Conducted sentiment and keyword analysis to extract customer themes.

- **Predictive Modelling**
  - Used machine learning to predict hotel booking behaviour.
  - Evaluated and fine-tuned a LightGBM classifier for better performance.

- **Business Communication**
  - Presented insights and methodology to stakeholders through PowerPoint decks.
